    "text": "As this is an exciting new frontier, we’re learning as we go. Or as my friend Lawrence says, “I like to build airplanes in the air-”. In the spirit of learning, let’s address some common issues you may come across…\n\nStuck at Loading webR…\nProblem: If you encounter the message Loading webR... above your code cell instead of Run code, it’s likely due to missing worker files (webr-worker.js and webr-serviceworker.js) in the document’s root or a relative directory.\nSolution: To resolve this issue, make sure that these worker files are located in the same directory as your Quarto document. Here’s the recommended directory structure:\n.\n├── demo-quarto-webr.qmd\n├── webr-serviceworker.js\n└── webr-worker.js\nIf you still encounter the error after confirming the file placement, check the output of the preview command in either the Terminal or RStudio’s Background Jobs tab. The output might resemble the following:\nquarto preview --no-browser --no-watch-inputs\n\nWatching files for changes \nGET: /website/posts/index.html\n /website/posts/webr-serviceworker.js (404: Not Found)\n /website/posts/webr-worker.js (404: Not Found)\nThis indicates that the webr-serviceworker.js and webr-worker.js files are missing during the rendering stage of your document. To fix this, add the resources key to your document header, explicitly specifying these two JavaScript files like so:\n---\ntitle: \"My Post\"\nresources:\n  - webr-serviceworker.js\n  - webr-worker.js\nfilters:\n  - webr\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe’ve informed the Quarto team about this issue regarding automatic inclusion of extension registered dependencies.\n\n\nIf the problem persists, you can specify the location of the worker files using the service-worker-url option in the document’s YAML header or set the channel-type option to \"post-message\". You can see an example of the later here.\n\n\nUnable to Render the Quarto File\nProblem: When I add the webr value to the filter section, my Quarto document fails to render and displays a lengthy error message.\nSolution: Quarto extensions are project-specific, which means you must install the extension for each new project you create. To resolve this issue, ensure that your project directory structure includes an _extensions directory with the appropriate extension files, as shown below:\n.\n├── _extensions\n│   └── coatless\n│       └── webr\n│           ├── _extension.yml\n│           ├── ...\n│           └── webr.lua\n└── test-document.qmd\nIf your directory is missing the _extensions/ folder, please install the webr extension by following the instructions in Install the quarto-webr extension video.\nStarting from Quarto v1.4, you will receive an improved error message that emphasizes the extension’s absence from your current working directory.\n\n\nMissing extension error for Quarto v1.4 and later\nFATAL (/Applications/quarto/share/filters/main.lua:129) An error occurred:\nCould not run /Users/jjb/github/demo-webr/webr as a JSON filter.\nPlease make sure the file exists and is executable.\n\nDid you intend 'webr' as a Lua filter in an extension?\nIf so, make sure you've spelled the name of the extension correctly.\n\nThe original Pandoc error follows below.\nError running filter /Users/jjb/github/demo-webr/webr:\nCould not find executable /Users/jjb/github/demo-webr/webr\n\n\nIn versions prior to Quarto v1.4, including v1.3 and earlier, the error message may differ, but it typically signals that the extension is either missing or not executable.\n\n\nMissing extension error for Quarto v1.3 and earlier\nError running filter /Applications/quarto/share/filters/main.lua:\nError running filter /Users/jjb/github/demo-webr/webr:\nCould not find executable /Users/jjb/github/demo-webr/webr\nstack traceback:\n        /Applications/quarto/share/filters/main.lua:4030: in function &lt;/Applications/quarto/share/filters/main.lua:4009&gt;\n        [C]: in ?\n        [C]: in method 'walk'\n        /Applications/quarto/share/filters/main.lua:171: in function 'run_emulated_filter'\n        /Applications/quarto/share/filters/main.lua:449: in local 'callback'\n        /Applications/quarto/share/filters/main.lua:454: in upvalue 'run_emulated_filter_chain'\n        /Applications/quarto/share/filters/main.lua:495: in function &lt;/Applications/quarto/share/filters/main.lua:476&gt;\nstack traceback:\n        /Applications/quarto/share/filters/main.lua:171: in function 'run_emulated_filter'\n        /Applications/quarto/share/filters/main.lua:449: in local 'callback'\n        /Applications/quarto/share/filters/main.lua:454: in upvalue 'run_emulated_filter_chain'\n        /Applications/quarto/share/filters/main.lua:495: in function &lt;/Applications/quarto/share/filters/main.lua:476&gt;\n\n\n\n\nDirectly Accessing Rendered HTML\nProblem: When I directly open the rendered HTML document in a web browser, webR components are not loaded due to security reasons.\nSolution: When you use quarto preview or quarto render, the rendered HTML document is served by mimicking a server running under https://localhost/. In this context, everything usually works fine if you follow the directory structure mentioned above.\nHowever, if you directly open the rendered HTML document (e.g., demo-quarto-web.html) in a web browser, you may encounter issues with WebR components not loading due to security restrictions. This behavior is explained further in this StackOverflow answer.\nTo address this problem and avoid the need for a local Quarto installation to open the rendered file directly, you have a few options:\n\nUse Chrome’s --allow-file-access-from-files access: You can modify your Chrome shortcut to include the --allow-file-access-from-files flag. This allows local files to access other local files, potentially resolving the issue.\nUse the WebServer for Chrome Extension: Install the WebServer for Chrome extension to serve your HTML files. This extension sets up a local web server that doesn’t have the same security restrictions as directly opening files.\nUse NPM to Obtain local-web-server: Install the local-web-server package from npm, which is a lightweight, no-configuration-required HTTP server. You can use it to serve your HTML files without encountering security restrictions.\n\n\n\nSpeed Up webR\nProblem: WebR documents are not performing as efficiently as expected.\nSolution: To optimize the performance of webR documents, it’s essential to set appropriate HTTP headers for COOP and COEP. These headers help speed up the process and ensure a smoother user experience.\nHere are the recommended COOP and COEP headers to use:\nCross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin\nCross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp\nBy configuring these headers, you enforce a same-origin policy for cross-origin windows and ensure that cross-origin iframes are required to have a COEP policy that allows cross-origin embedding. For more detailed instructions on setting up these headers, please refer to the \"shared-array-buffer\" channel type documentation.\n\n\nEngine Registration\nProblem: When using the knitr engine instead of the jupyter engine and the original tag {webr} instead of {webr-r}, a warning message may appear in the render processing output:\nWarning message:\nIn get_engine(options$engine) :\n  Unknown language engine 'webr' (must be registered via knit_engines$set()).\nSolution: The warning message about the unknown language engine ‘webr’ is purely cosmetic and does not affect the functionality of the webr filter. It is merely an aesthetic issue and does not impact the execution of code cells.\nThis warning occurs because the knitr engine is not initially aware of the webr engine. However, this lack of awareness does not cause any functional problems. The webr filter will operate as expected despite this warning.\nWhile the warning is not critical, it may be addressed in future updates for aesthetic reasons. Nevertheless, you can safely disregard this warning message as it does not interfere with the functionality of your webR documents.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Whether you need specialized statistical analysis, advanced visualization, or any other R-based functionality, you can harness the rich ecosystem of R packages directly within your documents. By default, quarto-webr avoids loading additional packages. However, you have two ways to incorporate packages into your document: one where packages are installed when the document opens, and the other where packages are installed interactively within specific code cells.\n\nAvailable R Packages\nBefore you use any R package with webR, it’s essential to check if it’s available. You can explore the available packages by executing the following R code, either with webR or just R:\n\n  🟡 Loading\n    webR...\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nAlternatively, you can navigate to the webR binary R repository here for package listings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nwebR reports the number of packages available in two ways:\n\nBuilt R packages: This indicates the number of R packages with WebAssembly binaries that can be used within webR, although they may have a decreased number of features available.\nAvailable R packages: This number represents feature-complete R packages that have all their dependencies compiled and are fully functional within webR.\n\nTo achieve parity with base R, the Available R packages metric serves as an indicator of whether R scripts may require further modification to function properly within webR.\n\n\n\n\nInstall R Packages on Document Open\nTo automatically install packages when the document opens, add the packages key under webr in the YAML header, listing the packages in an array:\n---\nwebr:\n  packages: ['ggplot2', 'dplyr']\n---\nBy using this approach, you ensure that necessary packages are available right from the start when readers access your document. Moreover, the webR code cells will not become active until the packages are installed and loaded. This can be especially helpful when working with packages in multiple cells.\nIf you do not want the packages to be loaded by default, add the autoload-packages: false under webr in the YAML header. This will disable the calls to load each R package in the packages key, e.g. library(package).\n---\nwebr:\n  packages: ['ggplot2', 'dplyr']\n  autoload-packages: false\n---\n\n\nInstalling an R Package Interactively\nIf you need to install a package interactively within specific code cells, you can do so using the webr::install() function. This method allows you to install packages on-the-fly when needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPlease note that not all R packages are immediately available for use with webR due to the presence of compiled code routines. The installation process might also take some time depending on the communication channel being used.\n\n\nLet’s take ggplot2 as an example:\n\n  🟡 Loading\n    webR...\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nUsing this approach, you can install packages on a per-code cell basis, which can be more efficient when you only need specific packages for certain parts of your document.\n\n\nLoad R Packages Interactively\nOnce an R package is installed, you can use it just like normal by calling either library() or require() to load the package.\nFor instance, if you have installed ggplot2 in the prior code cell, then the following will load the ggplot2 and create a scatterplot.\n\n  🟡 Loading\n    webR...\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nNot a fan of having a code cell dedicated to load packages? You can use the packages key option above to let the quarto-webr extension take care of loading the packages after installing.",

When you specify channel-type as \"shared-array-buffer\", webR aims to use something called SharedArrayBuffer. This choice, however, comes with some specific requirements and benefits:\nRequirements:\n\nYour web server needs to send web pages with webR using specific HTTP headers. This is to ensure that the page is cross-origin isolated. In simple terms, your server must be set up to allow this kind of communication otherwise webR will not work.\n\nBenefits:\n\nThe benefit of using this approach is that webR runs notably faster. It’s like giving webR a high-speed lane for its operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt’s important to note that the \"shared-array-buffer\" option isn’t currently available on platforms like GitHub Pages or Quarto Pub. If you’re using these services, we recommend using the channel-type: \"post-message\" option instead. There’s a possibility that GitHub Pages may offer the option to set the necessary headers in the future, as discussed here.\n\n\nTo help you set up the necessary headers for cross-origin isolation, we provide some guidance for both Netlify and nginx web server administrators:\nFor Netlify Configuration:\nIf you’re hosting your website with Netlify, you can add the following code to your netlify.toml configuration file:\n[[headers]]\n  for = \"/directory/with/webr/content/*\"\n\n  [headers.values]\n    Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy = \"same-origin\"\n    Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy = \"require-corp\"\nFor nginx Web Server Administrators:\nIf you’re managing a server with nginx, you can use the add_header directive in your server’s configuration file, which is usually found at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf. Here’s an example:\nserver {\n  # Enable headers for the webr directory\n  location ^~ /directory/with/webr/content {\n    add_header \"Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy\" \"same-origin\";\n    add_header \"Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy\" \"require-corp\";\n  }\n}\nBy following these instructions, you’ll ensure that your web server is set up to display web pages with a cross-origin isolated status, allowing you to use the \"shared-array-buffer\" option effectively.",

If you’re hosting documents with Quarto Pub, please use the channel-type: \"post-message\" option instead. There’s an ongoing effort to address the service worker upload issue with the Quarto team, which you can track here.\n\n\nWhen you set channel-type to \"service-worker\", webR changes its communication channel to use the Service Worker API. This means you need two worker scripts, webr-worker.js and webr-serviceworker.js, hosted on the same website as the page using webR.\nHere’s what you need to ensure:\n1. Worker Scripts: The quarto-webr extension will automatically create and register these workers when your Quarto document is rendered.\n2. Directory Structure: Your initial directory structure should include these files:\n.\n├── _extensions/coatless/webr\n└── demo-quarto-webr.qmd\nAfter rendering the Quarto document with the \"service-worker\" option, your directory will look like this:\n.\n├── _extensions/coatless/webr\n├── demo-quarto-webr.qmd\n├── demo-quarto-webr.html  # Rendered document\n├── webr-serviceworker.js  # Service workers\n└── webr-worker.js\n3.

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome to our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page, your go-to resource for finding answers to common queries about the quarto-webr extension. If you can’t find the answer you’re looking for, don’t hesitate to reach out to our community for additional support by opening a question or a bug report on the issue tracker.\n\nStability and Long Term Support\n\nQ. Would you say the quarto-webr extension API is stable? Thinking about starting to convert course notes and wondering where the project is in terms of stability.\n\nYes, the quarto-webr extension API can be considered stable for most practical purposes. It has undergone significant development and testing to ensure that it functions reliably and consistently within the Quarto framework. You can confidently start converting your course notes and materials using this extension.\nHowever, it’s important to keep in mind a few considerations:\n\nDependency on Quarto and webR projects: The quarto-webr extension relies on the main webR project for its core functionality. While we actively maintain the quarto-webr extension and aim to keep it compatible with the latest versions of Quarto and webR, we cannot control what happens upstream at either project. Changes or updates to either project may occasionally require adjustments in the extension. For the most part, these adjustments will be largely hidden.\nVersion compatibility: It’s important to note that the version of the R client and R packages that is downloaded for webR execution may affect your materials. It’s advisable to periodically review and update your teaching materials, especially when major changes occur in R version or R package contents, just as before.\nStart with a small set: When converting your course materials, it’s a good practice to start with a small set of materials as a pilot. This allows you to familiarize yourself with the extension’s functionality and raise/address any specific issues that may arise during the conversion process. Once you are comfortable with the workflow and have tested your materials, you should proceed with converting the rest of your course content.\n\n\n\nImproving Performance\n\n\nWhat are your plans, if any, for scaling webR to handle complex content faster?\n\n\nFor handling complex content, we recommend setting the channel-type option to the 'shared-array-buffer', which can significantly speed up its execution. This environment requires the proper configuration of HTTP headers for Cross-Origin Embedder Policy (COEP) and Cross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP). By setting these headers correctly, you can already achieve notable speed improvements when working with webR.\nHowever, for further enhancements and speed optimizations beyond what the COEP and COOP headers provide, we recommend keeping an eye on the main webR project’s documentation. The core webR project continuously works on improving performance and scalability, so any future advancements in handling complex content faster will likely originate from their developments.\n\n\nwebR Limitations\n\nQ. I noticed that built in docs with ? don’t work in webR. Are there any other known issues? How long to feature parity?\n\nRegarding feature parity with the main webR project, it’s important to understand that quarto-webr inherits the same limitations and capabilities as the core webR technology. Efforts to address these limitations and bring feature parity will depend on the ongoing development of webR itself and the evolution of WebAssembly and web browser capabilities. While there may be progress in mitigating some of these limitations over time, achieving complete feature parity may be a complex and ongoing process. In the case of help documentation, we added support in quarto-webr v0.3.7.\nThe known limitations at this time are:\n\nPackage Installation: Installing packages from source within webR is not currently supported. This limitation is unlikely to change in the near future as it would require a complete C and Fortran compiler toolchain to run within the browser. As a result, the only supported way to install R packages in webR is by providing pre-compiled WebAssembly binaries.\nGraphics Device: The webr::canvas() graphics device relies on OffscreenCanvas support in the web browser or JavaScript engine running webR. This means that a modern and up-to-date browser is required for plotting with this device. Older browsers without OffscreenCanvas support can still create plots using the Cairo-based graphics devices, such as png().\nCommunication Channels: webR relies on communication channels for interaction. Without cross-origin isolation, it falls back to the ServiceWorker communication channel, which may result in reduced performance or require additional setup.\nInterruption of Running Code: Interruption of running R code and the use of nested R REPLs (such as readline(), menu(), browser(), etc.) are unsupported when using the PostMessage communication channel.\nSystem Command: The system() command is not implemented in webR, which means that executing system-level commands from within R code or packages is not possible.\n\n\n\nState of Accessibility\n\nQ. You mentioned there has been some work on accessibility. I’m curious what the current state of accessibility is? What are the known issues?\n\nAccessibility is an important aspect of webR, and we are committed to ensuring that the tool is usable by individuals with disabilities. To address accessibility concerns, we have engaged the expertise of JooYoung Seo, an Assistant Professor in the School of Information Sciences (iSchool) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. JooYoung specializes in accessibility within Data Science and has been instrumental in conducting periodic accessibility reviews of webR.\nOne of the primary areas of focus has been making sure that screen readers can easily identify and interact with code cells on the page. This ensures that individuals with visual impairments can effectively use webR. While we’ve made significant strides in improving accessibility, we continue to work on addressing any known issues and enhancing the overall accessibility of the tool. We are committed to providing an inclusive and user-friendly experience for all users, and JooYoung’s expertise has been invaluable in this regard.\n\n\nPackage Usage\n\nQ. Does the use of R packages cause any issues for you when teaching content with webR and Quarto?\n\nWhen teaching content with webR and Quarto, the use of R packages is certainly supported. However, it’s important to be aware of a few considerations that can help ensure a smooth teaching experience.\nIn a typical R environment, packages are installed once and are available for subsequent sessions using library() or require(). In webR, packages are installed on each session. This means that each webR session starts with a clean slate, and packages need to be installed again for that specific session.\nTo optimize this process and avoid unnecessary downloads, it’s recommended to use the webr::install() function instead of the standard install.packages() function. webr::install() checks if a package is already installed and does not re-download it if it’s already available. This can significantly speed up the package installation process when working with webR and Quarto.\nOne way to simplify the teaching process and prevent students from working while packages are being installed is to use the built-in packages option in the document’s header. This option hides the installation process from students and ensures that the required packages are pre-installed when they access the document.\nFinally, it’s worth noting that the R packages available to webR may not always be the latest versions that you can get from CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network). Therefore, it’s a good practice to check the package versions and ensure compatibility with your teaching materials.\n\n\nDebugging\n\nQ. How are error messages, etc. communicated in webr’s interface? Would it be easy for a student to debug without the tools that are available in the RStudio?\n\nError messages, warnings, and other diagnostic information are presented in the output of a quarto-webr interface, just like in a standard R environment. These messages appear directly below the code cell that generated them. While quarto-webr provides a user-friendly interface for working with R in a web browser, it does not offer advanced debugging tools like debug(), debugonce(), debuggingState(), or setBreakpoint(). Therefore, debugging in quarto-webr is primarily reliant on interpreting the error messages and warnings displayed in the output. For students familiar with RStudio’s debugging tools, transitioning to quarto-webr may require an adjustment to debugging practices. However, the clear presentation of error messages in the output makes it relatively straightforward for students to identify and address issues in their code.\n\n\nStyling\n\nQ. Is it possible to style the UI elements the quarto-webr extension add to your document? Do they get affected by styling/theme changes so things look coherent?\n\nCertainly! You have the flexibility to style the UI elements added by the quarto-webr extension to your document. For more details, please see Theming Elements.",
