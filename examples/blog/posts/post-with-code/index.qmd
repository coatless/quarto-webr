This is a post with interactive code on a [Quarto Blog](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) through the [`quarto-webr`](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr) extension. The configuration setup for the `quarto-webr` extension is taken care of in the `_quarto.yml` file to avoid needing to re-specify options multiple times.

```{webr-r}
print("Hello blog Quarto world!")
```
