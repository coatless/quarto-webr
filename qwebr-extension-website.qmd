# Initializing the Project

To get started, follow these steps to set up the Quarto extension website project:

1. Create a new directory named `docs/` within your repository using the following command:
   
   ```sh
   mkdir docs && cd $_
   ```

2. Initialize a Quarto website project by running the following command:

   ```sh
   quarto create project website .
   ```

# Incorporating the Extension

To seamlessly integrate the extension into your project, you'll need to create a symbolic link to the `_extensions` folder containing the development version of the extension. This approach helps you avoid maintaining a duplicate copy of the extension in your Git repository history.

Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `docs/` directory in your project.

2. Create a symbolic link to the `_extensions` folder using the following command:

   ```sh
   ln -s ../_extensions _extensions
   ```
