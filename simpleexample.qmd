This is a webR-enabled code cell in a Quarto HTML document.
I set the editor font size to huge 40 points (original is 17.5 points)

```{webr-r}
fit = lm(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)

summary(fit)
```

## Now with font size option set in cell

This is a webR-enabled code cell in a Quarto HTML document.

```{webr-r}
#| editor-font-size: "25pt"
fit = lm(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)

summary(fit)
```
