This extension enables the [webR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/) code cell in a Quarto HTML document. 

```{webr-r}
fit = lm(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)
summary(fit)
```

The goal of [webR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/) is to: 

> run R code in the browser without the need for an R server to execute the code
