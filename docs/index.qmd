Welcome to the documentation portal for the [`quarto-webr`](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr) extension – your key to unlocking the endless possibilities of [webR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/) within various [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) formats, including [HTML](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html), [Websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/), and [Books](https://quarto.org/docs/books). 

Ready for an exciting journey into the world of webR's interactive code cells? Click the "Run Code" button below to experience it firsthand:

```{webr-r}
fit = lm(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)
summary(fit)
```

At its core, [webR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/) is all about empowering you to run R code directly in your web browser, completely bypassing the need for an external R server. The best part? This incredible capability extends far beyond its integration with the [Quarto extension](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr), giving you the freedom to harness the power of webR independently.

Let's dive in and kickstart your journey with interactive code cells by creating your very first [webR-powered Quarto document](webr-first-steps.qmd)!
