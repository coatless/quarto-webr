# 0.3.8: ???? (??-??-????) [DEV]

## Features

- Added `autoload-packages` document meta option key that will automatically load packages specified in the `packages` key. The default value is `true`. ([#75](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/issues/75))
  - This feature simplifies the use of packages, eliminating the need to call `library()` in interactive code cells or setup code cells, as the specified packages will be loaded automatically. 

## Bugfixes

## Documentation

- Added a subsection to using two keyboard shortcuts into the interactive code cell demo. 
- Miscellaneous documentation typo fixes.

## Deployment

- Added a `tests/` directory that contains Quarto documents used across multiple browsers before triggering a point release. ([#76](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/issues/76))

# 0.3.7: Mutex On, Mutex Off (10-16-2023)

## Features

- Added a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) to ensures that only one code cell runs at a time, preventing simultaneous execution conflicts.
  - With this enhancement, you can now enjoy smoother and more predictable execution of your code, without interference from concurrently running code cells.
- Added a visual spinning indicator to emphasize what code cell is currently running. ([#64](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/issues/64), [#17](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/issues/17))
- Improved status updates about installing R packages specified in the document's `package` key. ([#68](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/issues/68))
- Fully supported `pager` event types. ([#58](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/issues/58))
  - With this update, looking at R help documentation for a function is now possible.

## Bugfixes

- Fixed `base-url` to allow for a localized version of `webR` away. ([#54](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/issues/54))
- Fixed document-level `packages` meta option not installing packages if the status bar was not present ([#69](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/issues/69))
- Fixed service workers not being placed if user explicitly set `channel-type: 'automatic'` ([#74](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/pull/74))

## Documentation

- Added an [`examples/` directory](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/tree/main/examples) containing examples for [HTML Documents](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/tree/main/examples/html-document), [Books](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/tree/main/examples/book), and [Websites](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/tree/main/examples/websites). ([#53](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/issues/53))
- Added a documentation page that contains the extension updates and release dates. 
- Added an FAQ page covering questions from posit::conf(2023). ([#56](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/issues/56))

## Deployment

- Switched from Quarto's publishing action to individually rendering projects, merging output, and, then, publishing. ([#73](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/pull/73))
  - By using a custom publish action, we can retain a single repository with nested quarto projects (e.g. A website project that also contains a book.)

# 0.3.6: Ready, Set, Run. (09-24-2023)

## Feature

- Improved the run selected code shortcut to now also run the current line if no selection is present and advance to the next. (#43)
   - Use: <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> on Windows

## Bugfixes

- Fixed space not being preserved (h/t @nguyenllpsych, #39)
- Fixed webR not initializing if a document lacked a title (h/t @jimhester, #40)

## Documentation

- Added a walkthrough video to the [getting started page](https://quarto-webr.thecoatlessprofessor.com/webr-first-steps.html).
- Added a new page containing [community examples](https://quarto-webr.thecoatlessprofessor.com/webr-community-examples.html) of the `quarto-webr` extension in the wild. 
- Added an example on fill-in-the-blank usage.
- Clarified how interactive code cells could be used to explore what-if scenarios.
- Minor documentation fixes.

## Deployment

- Add new issue templates for questions and examples.
- Improved GitHub repo issue template formatting.

# 0.3.5: Seance of Communication Channels (09-17-2023)

## Features

- New documentation website is available at: <https://quarto-webr.thecoatlessprofessor.com> 
- Document option `channel-type` sets the communication channel webR uses. 
   - `channel-type: automatic`  (default): Communicates using either `shared-array-buffer` or `service-worker`.
   - `channel-type: shared-buffer-array`:  Fastest communication option, but requires setting up HTTP headers.
   - `channel-type: service-worker`: Slower communication option and requires worker scripts to be next to the rendered document.
   - `channel-type: post-message`: Easiest setup option at the expense of being unable to interrupt the R process or accept user-input.
- Code cell option `context` controls whether the code and output are shown or suppressed.
   - `context: interactive`(default) shows both code and output. 
   - `context: setup` suppresses both code and output. 
   - `context: output` suppresses code but shows its output. 
   - To use the new hidden code cell feature, the code cell needs `#| context: <value>` like so:

````md
```{webr-r}
#| context: setup

my_hidden_variable = 11
```
````

## Bugfixes

- Fixed webR status indicator appearing outside of the header. (#33)
- Fixed button styling difference between standalone documents and website-based documents.
 
## Documentation

- Created the `docs` folder inside the repository to host the documentation website.
- Moved documentation from the README.md file onto separate web pages.
   - _Acknowledgements_ now has a dedicated page thanking contributors and collaborators.
   - _Developer resources_ expands on the reference resources.
   - _Using R packages_ describes the best practices for using R's ecosystem of extensions
   -  _Customization Options_ describes the document level options available to be set in document's YAML field.
- Added new documentation entries for hidden code cell evaluation and communication channels.
- Added a rendered version of the README example to the website. 
- Incorporated additional examples into the "Exploring Interactive Code Cells" demo document.
 
## Deployment

- Added a Quarto action to render and publish the documentation website.
- Added issue templates for feature requests and bug fixes.
- Symlink the `_extension` directory into `docs` to avoid needing to add the extension on each render.

- Set options directly inside the document's YAML header to control webR:
    - Support is available for setting the following [WebR.WebROptions](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/api/js/interfaces/WebR.WebROptions.html) options:
        - `home-dir`: The WebAssembly user’s home directory and initial working directory ([`Documentation`](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/api/js/interfaces/WebR.WebROptions.html#homedir)). Default: `'/home/web_user'`.
        - `base-url`: The base URL used for downloading R WebAssembly binaries. ([`Documentation`](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/api/js/interfaces/WebR.WebROptions.html#baseurl)). Default: `'https://webr.r-wasm.org/[version]/'`.
        - `service-worker-url`: The base URL from where to load JavaScript worker scripts when loading webR with the ServiceWorker communication channel mode ([`Documentation`](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/api/js/interfaces/WebR.WebROptions.html#serviceworkerurl)). Default: `''`.
- webR initialization status stages are now described and shown as stoplights (inspired by [Bob Rudis](https://github.com/hrbrmstr))
    - `show-startup-message`: Display in the document header the state of WebR initialization. Default: `true`

# 0.0.4: Execute webr cells when developing in VS Code or RStudio (03-30-2023)

## Breaking Changes

- We've transitioned to using the `{webr-r}` code cell designation from our original `{webr}` designation.
   - The `{webr-r}` tag allows for code cell evaluation prior to rendering the document
   - Moreover, the `{webr-r}` component does not need to be registered under the `knitr` compute engine.


# 0.0.3: Escape Escape! (03-19-2023)

## Bugfix

- Escape characters `\` are further escaped.

````
```{webr}
add_one <- \(x) x + 1
add_one(2)
```
````

Should now appear in a webR code cell as:

```r
add_one <- \(x) x + 1
add_one(2)
```

## Documentation

- Added details on how to host webR content
- Added additional examples and details in the `webr-demo.qmd` file.
