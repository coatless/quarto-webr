We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to several individuals and teams who played a pivotal role in bringing [`quarto-webR`](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr) to life as an extension for Quarto. Without their dedication and contributions, this project would not have been possible.

## Inspirations

Our project built upon the initial proof of concept for a standalone Quarto HTML document, made possible by the work of the [coatless-r-n-d/webR-quarto-demos](https://github.com/coatless-r-n-d/webR-quarto-demos) repository.

Additionally, we were inspired by the following public-facing examples from the webR Core developers:

- [Source of Tidyverse Blog Post](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse.org/pull/617/files) and [Minor fix](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse.org/commit/72bb2dd7ca0b2f211498a891aa54f55ddcad5014)
- [webR documentation landing page](https://github.com/r-wasm/webr/blob/53acd8861c44f1f167941d0a40f62b0cc23852da/src/docs/index.qmd#L23-L68) ([Live page](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/))
