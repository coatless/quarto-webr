This document tests the `repos` key meta option by attempting to download a package `demorwasmbinary` from a custom repository at:

<https://tutorials.thecoatlessprofessor.com/webr-unified-gh-workflow/>

And, then, falls back on the main webR repository for a second package `visualize`.

```{webr-r}
#| context: output

print(paste0("Check if we are in webR with non-CRAN package demorwasmbinary: ", demorwasmbinary::in_webr()))

print("Creating a graph with a package on CRAN")
visualize::visualize.norm()
```
