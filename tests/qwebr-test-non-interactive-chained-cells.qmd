We've slowed down each cell's execution time by about 1/4 of a second to show how the document is responding.

# Package dependencies

The `quarto-webr` extension is set to automatically install and load the `ggplot2` and `dplyr` packages by specifying a `packages` key in the document's header. 

# Setup a hidden ggplot2 object

From there, we're going to use the `context: setup` hidden cell to create a `ggplot2` object that uses the `mtcars` data set with the aesthetic mappings of `x = wt` and `y = mpg` called `g`.

```{webr-r}
#| context: setup
g <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) 

Sys.sleep(0.25)
```

# Generate a graph

Let's move from setup to generating and displaying results by using `g` object created in `setup` within an `output` context:

```{webr-r}
#| context: output
g + geom_point()

Sys.sleep(0.25)
```

# Re-use prior graph object

Let's also re-use the base `g` but change the aesthetics so that colour is now present.

```{webr-r}
#| context: output
g + geom_point(aes(colour = factor(cyl)))
Sys.sleep(0.25)
```

# Expose the setup object

Finally, let's make sure we can do some interesting things with the interactive session.

Changes inside of interactive cells do not propagate backwards in the document.
